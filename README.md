  #### Description: This project represents the culmination of my work in Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python course. The main goal of this project was to create an interactive game that simulates the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trading. By leveraging real-time APIs, the game provides players with a thrilling and immersive experience, allowing them to buy and sell virtual cryptocurrencies based on live exchange rates.

The game is designed to offer players a practical understanding of how cryptocurrency trading works. Players start with a set amount of virtual money and a starting cryptocurrency, and they can engage in various actions to manage their virtual portfolio. This includes buying and selling cryptocurrencies, tracking transaction history, and analyzing their portfolio's performance. The use of real-time APIs ensures that players experience the volatility and excitement of the cryptocurrency market as it changes.

Integrating a cryptocurrency API into the project presented significant challenges. Initially, I struggled to find a reliable API that would provide the necessary data for my game. The process of researching and testing different APIs took considerable time and effort. However, overcoming these challenges was a rewarding experience. Once I successfully integrated the API and started seeing real-time data reflected in the game, my enthusiasm grew.

To ensure the game was enjoyable and functional, I invited several friends to test it out. Their feedback was invaluable in refining the gameplay experience. It was incredibly satisfying to see others engage with the game and provide constructive criticism. Their insights helped me make necessary adjustments and improvements, enhancing the overall quality of the project.

The development process for this game was both challenging and enjoyable. It spanned several weeks, during which I dedicated significant time to coding, testing, and debugging. Each step brought its own set of obstacles, but the sense of accomplishment upon completing each phase of the project kept me motivated.
